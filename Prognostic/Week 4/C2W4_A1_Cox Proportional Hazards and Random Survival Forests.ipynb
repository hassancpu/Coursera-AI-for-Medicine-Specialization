In this assignment you'll develop risk models using survival data and a combination of linear and non-linear techniques. We'll be using a dataset with survival data of patients with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (pbc). PBC is a progressive disease of the liver caused by a buildup of bile within the liver (cholestasis) that results in damage to the small bile ducts that drain bile from the liver. Our goal will be to understand the effects of different factors on the survival times of the patients. Along the way you'll learn about the following topics: \n","\n","- Cox Proportional Hazards\n","  - Data Preprocessing for Cox Models.\n","- Random Survival Forests\n","  - Permutation Methods for Interpretation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FoGiYimn9wsw","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Outline\n","\n","- [1.

Cox Proportional Hazards\n","\n","Our goal is to build a risk score using the survival data that we have. We'll begin by fitting a Cox Proportional Hazards model to your data.\n","\n","Recall that the Cox Proportional Hazards model describes the hazard for an individual $i$ at time $t$ as \n","\n","$$\n","\\lambda(t, x) = \\lambda_0(t)e^{\\theta^T X_i}\n","$$\n","\n","The $\\lambda_0$ term is a baseline hazard and incorporates the risk over time, and the other term incorporates the risk due to the individual's covariates. After fitting the model, we can rank individuals using the person-dependent risk term $e^{\\theta^T X_i}$. \n","\n","Categorical variables cannot be used in a regression model as they are. In order to use them, conversion to a series of variables is required.\n","\n","Since our data has a mix of categorical (`stage`) and continuous (`wblc`) variables, before we proceed further we need to do some data engineering. To tackle the issue at hand we'll be using the `Dummy Coding` technique. In order to use Cox Proportional Hazards, we will have to turn the categorical data into one hot features so that we can fit our Cox model. Luckily, Pandas has a built-in function called `get_dummies` that will make it easier for us to implement our function. It turns categorical features into multiple binary features.\n","\n","<img src=\"1-hot-encode.png\" style=\"padding-top: 5px;width: 60%;left: 0px;margin-left: 150px;margin-right: 0px;\">\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Yj0LDmxs9wtd","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<a name='Ex-1'></a>\n","### Exercise 1\n","In the cell below, implement the `to_one_hot(...)` function."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-wlRThoi9wte","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<details>    \n","<summary>\n","    <font size=\"3\" color=\"darkgreen\"><b>Hints</b></font>\n","</summary>\n","<p>\n","<ul>\n","    <li>Remember to drop the first dummy for each each category to avoid convergence issues when fitting the proportional hazards model.</li>\n","    <li> Check out the <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.get_dummies.html\" > get_dummies() </a>  documentation. </li>\n","    <li>Use <code>dtype=np.float64</code>.</li>\n","</ul>\n","</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"VMzvx0xF_C3I","colab":{},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1597644180649,"user_tz":-270,"elapsed":1505,"user":{"displayName":"Hassan KeshvariKhojasteh","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhRHRYK7qaghAdYe4qnimiyyI9MZjzoeZ_MpF_o=s64","userId":"00516321613958861415"}}},"source":["# UNQ_C1 (UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)\n","def to_one_hot(dataframe, columns):\n","    '''\n","    Convert columns in dataframe to one-hot encoding.\n","    Args:\n","        dataframe (dataframe): pandas dataframe containing covariates\n","        columns (list of strings): list categorical column names to one hot encode\n","    Returns:\n","        one_hot_df (dataframe): dataframe with categorical columns encoded\n","                            as binary variables\n","    '''\n","    \n","    ### START CODE HERE (REPLACE INSTANCES OF 'None' with your code) ###\n","    one_hot_df = pd.get_dummies(dataframe, columns= columns, drop_first= True,\n","                                dtype= np.float64)\n","        \n","    ### END CODE HERE ###\n","    \n","    return one_hot_df"],"execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"rM2tIzvG_ifc"},"source":["Now we'll use the function you coded to transform the training, validation, and test sets."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"SGZfLeup_fUL","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":73},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1597644184759,"user_tz":-270,"elapsed":1775,"user":{"displayName":"Hassan KeshvariKhojasteh","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhRHRYK7qaghAdYe4qnimiyyI9MZjzoeZ_MpF_o=s64","userId":"00516321613958861415"}},"outputId":"54337413-2224-4845-f79e-4cf35b5f49c7"},"source":["# List of categorical columns\n","to_encode = ['edema', 'stage']\n","\n","one_hot_train = to_one_hot(df_train, to_encode)\n","one_hot_val = to_one_hot(df_val, to_encode)\n","one_hot_test = to_one_hot(df_test, to_encode)\n","\n","print(one_hot_val.columns.tolist())\n","print(f\"There are {len(one_hot_val.columns)} columns\")"],"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["['time', 'status', 'trt', 'age', 'sex', 'ascites', 'hepato', 'spiders', 'bili', 'chol', 'albumin', 'copper', 'alk.phos', 'ast', 'trig', 'platelet', 'protime', 'edema_0.5', 'edema_1.0', 'stage_2.0', 'stage_3.0', 'stage_4.0']\n","There are 22 columns\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NJX-4NvA9wto","colab_type":"text"},"source":["#### Expected output\n","```Python\n","['time', 'status', 'trt', 'age', 'sex', 'ascites', 'hepato', 'spiders', 'bili', 'chol', 'albumin', 'copper', 'alk.phos', 'ast', 'trig', 'platelet', 'protime', 'edema_0.5', 'edema_1.0', 'stage_2.0', 'stage_3.0', 'stage_4.0']\n","There are 22 columns\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CwvRihrj9wtp","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Look for new features\n","Now, let's take a peek at one of the transformed data sets.
